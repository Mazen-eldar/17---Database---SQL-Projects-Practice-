--  Problem 44: Get Total Number Of Doors Manufactured by 'Ford'
SELECT 
    Makes.Make, 
    SUM(VehicleDetails.NumDoors) AS TotalNumberOfDoors
FROM 
    VehicleDetails 
INNER JOIN 
    Makes ON VehicleDetails.MakeID = Makes.MakeID AND Makes.Make='Ford'
GROUP BY 
    Makes.Make
ORDER BY 
    TotalNumberOfDoors DESC;

--ANOTHER WAY
SELECT        Makes.Make, Sum(VehicleDetails.NumDoors) AS TotalNumberOfDoors
FROM            VehicleDetails INNER JOIN
                         Makes ON VehicleDetails.MakeID = Makes.MakeID

Group By Make
Having Make='Ford'

/*
-- The first solution is more efficient and preferred for this case.
-- By placing the condition "Makes.Make = 'Ford'" inside the JOIN clause,
-- we filter the data *before* the aggregation happens, which improves performance.
-- It avoids unnecessary grouping of other makes, reduces the data being processed,
-- and results in cleaner and faster execution.
-- In contrast, the second solution applies the filter after grouping using HAVING,
-- which is less optimal when you're only interested in one specific make.
