/*
-- The first solution using TOP(1) with ORDER BY is preferred here.
-- It returns both the make and the number of models, giving more meaningful results.
-- The second solution only returns the maximum number, without the make name.
-- So, for real-world usage where we need to know *which* make had the most models,
-- the first query is clearly the better and more informative choice.
